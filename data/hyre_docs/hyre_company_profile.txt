💸 How much does a bad hire in Tech really cost? it runs far deeper than payroll.
Here’s how the numbers usually break down 👇
Direct costs:
 👨💻 Salary + Super (3–6 months): $60K–$90K
 🧾 Hiring time : Time of internal staff in process $15K
 🧠 Onboarding & training: $10K–$20K
 📉 Final pay/admin/legal: $5K–$10K
Indirect costs:
 ⏳ Productivity drag on the team: $20K–$50K+
 🚧 Project delays, missed milestones: $50K–$100K+
 📉 Opportunity cost (revenue, roadmap, morale) Priceless
👉 Conservative total: $160K–$300K+
And that’s assuming the hire is removed quickly. Let it drag and the damage compounds.
In a small team, one misfire can set you back quarters.
We have helped 200+ companies hire across Product Engineering, Cloud, and Data. If you're scaling and want to hear what we see that works, get in touch 😊

🌱 Looking for an AI recommendation!
We’re looking to partner with someone who can help build custom AI Agents for Hyre.
Working almost exclusively with native AI companies or SaaS businesses actively implementing AI, I’m getting incredible exposure to how teams are thinking about Agentic AI and how it will reshape productivity. 🧠
It’s sparked a big shift in my own thinking too.
There are some clear ways we could use Agents inside Hyre to take repetitive work off our hands so we can spend more time doing what actually drives results — talking to or meeting people. 💬
I’d love to connect with individuals or companies building Agent style solutions, especially ones who get how boutique businesses operate and want to be part of a sharp, outcome driven project. 🚀
Tag, DM or intro me I’m all ears! 👇 - joe@hyre.com.au
