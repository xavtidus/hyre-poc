## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- OpenAI API key
- LlamaCloud API key (for document parsing)

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and activate
git clone https://github.com/xavtidus/hyre-poc.git
cd hyre-poc
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_llamacloud_key
```

### Run the Application
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.rag.api:app --reload --port 8000

# Server will be available at http://localhost:8000
# Interactive test page: http://localhost:8000/test
```

## API Endpoints & Sample Queries

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

### 2. RAG Query (`/ask`) - Direct document search
```bash
# About Hyre company
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Hyre's company mission and focus areas?"}'

# Office location
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Where is Hyre located and what is their contact information?"}'

# Job requirements
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the key technical requirements for the Principal AI Engineer role?"}'

# Candidate background
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Xavier Hutchinson's experience with AWS and cloud technologies?"}'
```

### 3. Agent Query (`/agent`) - ReAct agent with tools
The agent can use both internal RAG search and web search to answer questions.

```bash
# Compare job requirements with candidate skills
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Compare Hyre job requirements with Xavier'\''s AWS experience"}'

# Market research with web search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the latest trends in AI consulting in Australia?"}'

# Technical architecture question
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How should I design a RAG pipeline for financial services compliance?"}'

# Company and role analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Based on Hyre's company profile, what specific AI solutions could help their recruitment process?"}'
```

- **Monitoring & Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration
- **Security Hardening**: IAM, secrets management, network policies

---

## Agent Capabilities

The LangGraph ReAct agent (`/agent` endpoint) provides:

- **Reasoning**: Step-by-step thought process for complex queries
- **Tool Selection**: Intelligent choice between internal RAG and web search
- **Multi-step Planning**: Breaks down complex questions into sub-queries
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation context and state

**Available Tools:**
- `rag_search`: Searches Hyre company docs, job descriptions, and candidate CV
- `web_search`: Public web search for current information and trends

---

## Data Sources

The RAG system is trained on:
- **Hyre Company Profile**: Mission, services, team size, contact info
- **Job Description**: Principal AI Engineer role requirements and tech stack  
- **Candidate CV**: Xavier Hutchinson's experience and qualifications
- **Website Content**: Achievements, testimonials, and additional company info

---

## Security & Best Practices

- **API Key Management**: Environment-based configuration
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: (Planned) Request throttling for production use
- **Secrets Management**: (Planned) AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager integration
